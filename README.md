Deep learning has seen great success in the field of natural language processing, or NLP. Throughout daily life, NLP is applied in a variety of ways. This project aims to explore the application of deep learning techniques in NLP to autocomplete partially written sentences. As we train our NLP model, we'll also look at how we may produce clean data. In this post, we'll go over the subsequent actions.

1. Cleaning the text data for training the NLP model
2. Loading the dataset using PyTorch
3. Creating the LSTM model
4. Training an NLP model
5. Making inferences from the trained model
